# coinbase-trading-tool-ai-agent

A trading bot DApp designed for beginners, making trading as easy as placing an order on Robinhood or Chase:

One-click order placement (Limit / DCA / Stop Order)

Automatic execution & management

No need for complex wallet operations or manual signatures

Using the Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) tools, we remove the friction for Web3 newcomers, making trading as intuitive as Web2 financial apps.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Coinbase Tools

1. Coinbase Onramp

Allows beginners to directly purchase USDC or PYUSD with credit/debit cards.

Assets are automatically deposited into the in-app wallet.

Pain point solved: Eliminates the “register exchange → buy crypto → withdraw” hassle.

2. CDP Smart Wallet (Embedded)

Automatically creates an embedded wallet when a new user logs in.

Login options: Email / Google / Social login.

Pain point solved: Users don’t need to understand “private keys/seed phrases” to start trading.

3. CDP Data APIs

Token Balance API: Displays real-time PYUSD/USDC/ETH balances.

Event API: Tracks order status and execution notifications.

Pain point solved: Just like Web2 financial apps, users can clearly see if their order has been executed.

4. x402 (Streaming Payments)

Applied to subscription-based trading bots:

Users pay small amounts of PYUSD/USDC per second for bot usage.

Stop anytime → billing stops instantly.

Pain point solved: Lowers payment risk. More flexible than Netflix monthly fees.

# 💡 Example User Flow

New user enters the app → Email login (Embedded Wallet auto-generated).

Use Onramp to buy $50 USDC → Automatically credited to wallet.

In the UI, choose trading method:

“Place limit order: Buy ETH at 0.98 USDC”

“Auto-buy 10 USDC ETH every hour” (DCA)

Bot automatically signs and executes orders → No MetaMask popups.

User tracks order status via Event API.

For advanced features → Enable x402 Streaming Subscription for AI strategy trading, billed per second.
